# ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

While developing this application, the following assumptions were made:

- The primary currency for price comparison is **INR**
- Only top 10â€“20 cryptocurrencies are needed for both views
- CoinGecko API is used instead of CoinMarketCap due to:
  - No API key requirement
  - Public/free and reliable
  - Easier integration
- Animation is kept minimal as per performance and simplicity goals
- The app is optimized for mobile and scales up to desktop
- No authentication, login, or user-specific features are required
